# Flying research roadmap

Flying studies computational models using actual Drosophila connectome structure.
It does not demonstrate a living fly memorizing pi. Always distinguish
**representation** (past inputs affect state), **decoding** (a head extracts useful
information), and **learning** (experience modifies recurrent connections).

## Current position — 2026-09-29

**ACT III-A current-model population panel complete.**
[Results](neuron-panel-results.md): input-only controls, broader group panel and
fresh-seed confirmation complete; DAN refit/APL frozen sensitivity confirmed with
count/input-matching limitations. Next one study: DAN edge-count/weight-matched
ablation controls (ACT III-B).

| Axis | Completed scope | Remaining scope |
|---|---|---|
| ACT I | Matched partial/expanded/whole graphs, thresholds5/1; no established whole-brain recall advantage | Broader tasks or dynamics require separate protocols |
| ACT II | Four-family pilot, length/alphabet scaling scopes, context and delayed-state diagnostics | Additional families and full length-by-K design remain open |
| ACT III-A | KCγ/full/disjoint/frozen/refit confirmation; input-only28 and broader population299 conditions; sensitivity map | Whole-brain/downstream and autonomous-recall population localization are untested extensions |
| ACT III-B/C/D | Earlier scoped topology controls available | Matched edge studies and broader critical-subnetwork mechanisms remain open |
| ACT IV | Earlier local-rule implementation with negative functional results | Useful internal learning without external decoder dependence |
| ACT V | Scoped robustness curves exposed strong fragility | Broader perturbation/physiological validation, kept separate |

현재 두686-neuron 부분 회로의 **ACT III-A 연구 단락을 종료**했다.
완료는 고정한 실험·검증을 끝냈다는 뜻이며 전체 뇌의 기억 위치를 규명했다는
뜻이 아니다. 다음은 DAN 집단의 효과와 제거 연결량을 구분하는 edge 대조다.

## ACT I — Can a Fly Brain Remember?

Close the matched partial/whole-brain question first: legacy5, left5, left1,
brain5, brain1; fixed exact input IDs, 48 observed MBON IDs and 482 readout
parameters. [Protocol](whole-brain-memory-protocol.md),
[results](whole-brain-memory-results.md), [status](research-status.md).
Separate expansion, weak-edge restoration and observed representation diversity.
Do not tune a negative result into a positive headline.

## ACT II — Beyond pi

The initial four-family pilot is now executed: [protocol](sequence-memory-protocol.md),
[results](sequence-memory-results.md). Both networks support the prespecified
limited beyond-pi claim on these trained instances; whole-brain superiority is
not established. The [random length curve](length-scaling-results.md) is also
complete at N32–512, with no whole-brain superiority. The subsequent
[N512 prefix-loss-mass diagnostic](prefix-mass-results.md) confirms prefix gains
on fresh seeds but fails the predefined later teacher-forced cost tolerance in
both graphs. It changes decoder allocation on identical reservoir trajectories.
The [independent-stream delayed-symbol comparison](delayed-symbol-results.md)
is now complete: partial60.42% / whole-brain51.10% past-lag accuracy, with
20 exact repeats. Whole-brain superiority fails. The fixed-N128
[alphabet comparison](alphabet-memory-results.md) is also complete:80 fits,
80 exact replays and8 independent refits. Both graphs pass trained-prefix gates
at all four K, but no K establishes whole-brain superiority. Recall grows from
K2 toK16, so the registered load-drop endpoint fails. The subsequent
[finite-context diagnostic](context-memory-results.md) is complete:120 controls
on20 unique tasks, with both registered endpoints passing. Context distinctiveness
is a supported explanation candidate, not an identified neural cause. Next is one
[fixed-K intervention](context-intervention-results.md), now complete. Confirmed graphs: none. The selected [blocked-state diagnostic](frozen-state-probe-results.md), [cross-arm transfer](cross-arm-probe-results.md) and subsequent [K4 structural control](structural-k4-results.md) are complete. The latter finds no real-wiring advantage; the subsequent normalization control is also complete with failed material-effect confirmation. Frozen-head transfer and train-only moment alignment are complete; the residual mode/orientation diagnostics are also complete, and fresh-seed alignment confirmation is complete with replicated improvement but failed portability; KCγ refit ablation and a disjoint follow-up are complete without specificity support. Frozen-head lesion decoding is complete with a large refit benefit but no specificity; fresh paired-seed confirmation is complete. Input-only silencing and the broader population panel with fresh confirmation are now complete; see the current-model ACT III-A closeout above.
Full length-by-alphabet scaling and additional families remain open. The paragraph
below describes the staged scope, not an assertion that all stages are complete.

After ACT I, begin with only pi, seeded random digits, shuffled pi (same multiset)
and a periodic sequence, comparing whole brain to the strongest established
baseline/control. Later add e, sqrt(2), motifs and low-order Markov sequences.
Treat symbols as integers; expose K=2,4,10,16 rather than silently coercing decimal
pi. Pi digits are not assumed mathematically random. Extend SequenceDataset
without changing archived ACT I behavior.

Length curves: 32,64,128,256,512 and 1024 only if feasible. Refit separately at
each length and show the recall-collapse region. Retain Pi Memory Score and add
L log2(K) recalled-prefix bits; do not call it Shannon capacity or the formal
reservoir-computing memory capacity. Structured/Markov data additionally require
statistical-prediction controls because predictability can mimic memory.

## ACT III — Where does the model store useful information?

The bounded current-model neuron panel is now executed: see [completion scope
ledger](neuron-panel-results.md). Downstream populations absent from the partial
graphs and whole-brain localization remain untested. The broader blueprint follows.

Test annotated KC/MBON/DAN/APL and downstream groups, hubs and matched random
groups. Keep frozen-head ablation distinct from post-ablation readout refitting.
Remove matched edge counts by strength, randomness, module boundary or graph
centrality, respecting whole-brain compute limits.
Use multiple controls: degree-preserving rewiring, weight permutation, role-block
preserving shuffle and matched random graphs. Explicitly list preserved and
destroyed properties; random graph alone is not sufficient.
Deliver sensitivity maps and candidate memory-critical subnetworks **in this
computational model**, not biological memory-circuit claims.

## ACT IV — Can internal connections learn?

Only after I–III. One hypothesis and one rule at a time: dopamine-gated plasticity,
local eligibility traces, STDP-like or compartment-specific learning.
Compare frozen real reservoir + trained head, random reservoir + trained head,
plastic reservoir + simple head, and possible direct internal decoding.
Preserve Phase 5B's negative recall/response findings. Separate external decoder
learning from internal synaptic learning.

## ACT V — Robustness (independent axis)

Use predefined curves for initial/ongoing noise, edge/neuron dropout and weight
perturbation. Preserve the existing clean-versus-perturbed failures. Do not pool
perturbed outcomes with ACT I's clean main comparison or present computational
noise amplitudes as biological calibration.

## Execution discipline

Protocol before outcomes; explicit stopping rules and finite seeds; fresh-seed
confirmation of positive discoveries; diagnostics after negatives. Save every
seed, failure, checkpoint, configuration, code/data hash, package lock and
resource measurement. Report paired differences, mean, median, variance,
descriptive uncertainty and effect sizes without treating tiny computational
cohorts as biological replication. No success-metric changes after outcomes.
